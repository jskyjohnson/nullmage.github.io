# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>

I'm a double major in Computer Science, and Technology Arts and Media. With a minor in Applied Mathematics.

I like to do a lot of things. Especially involving computers, my undergraduate career had a lot of focus on Data Science and Machine Learning.

I also have experience in the world of Physical computing! I love making small projects on the side, or designing, modeling, CAD-ing, manufacturing a project that does something interesting. Or interacts with the local environment.

Besides that, I have tons of experience in Unity, Augmented reality or Virtual Reality application building (On Hololens and DayDream), as well as stand alone game development (one of my favorite experiences).
